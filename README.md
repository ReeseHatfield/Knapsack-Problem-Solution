# Knapsack Problem
This Project is a solution to the famous problem in computer science, the knapsack problem. This solution makes use of a genetic algorithm

# What is the Knapsack Problem
Picture this, you are an adventurer exploring a cave full of treasure, but your knapsack can only hold a certain amount of weight. How do you maximize the value of your treasure when you can only can only hold very little in your knapsack? When there is only a small amount of items, it can be pretty simple to simply brute force the optimal combination of items. However, when their is a large amount of items, brute forcing the problem is near impossible. So, the way this is done, is by implementing a genetic algorithm.
